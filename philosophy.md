# TL;DR

I'm a guy who thinks that the web has lost its way. I'm always excited to be a small part of trying to heal what's still great.

# It should be possible to view this site without JS

Javascript is a really important part of webapps, but it's overused in static webpages (and many web apps). I never use it for essential parts of the page.

# It should be possible to view this site without CSS

Yup! Even CSS has [the potential to exfiltrate user data](https://curesec.com/blog/article/blog/Reading-Data-via-CSS-Injection-180.html).

I don't use it this way, obviously, but the sufficiently paranoid may want to disable CSS as well.

I've tried to make my website work without any of this. This means making sure that the DOM makes sense and is laid out sensibly, and everything uses the right kinds of tags.

It's a refreshing exercise, and valuable from an a11y standpoint. Try my site without styles -- I dare you. :-)

# In fact you shouldn't even have to visit the site.

I generate an RSS feed at the same time as I render the core articles. I strive to make it possible to use an RSS reader without setting foot on the site, and I encourage you to consume and remix the things I write however works best for you.

# If you want to buy me hot chocolate (or hosting) consider donating.

You don't have to, but much appreciated if you do.
